# Stanford Machine Learning Course Implementations

This project is implemented by MATLAB and includes  four main parts: 

### Linear and Logistic Regression include six parts: 
  * Single Variable Linear Regression 
  * Multi-Variable Linear Regression 
  * Regularized Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression (without regularization)
  * One-vs-all Classification
  * Regularized Logistic Regression
### Neural Network 
  Feedforward and the backpropagation algorithms for neural networks handwritten digits pattern recognition. 
### K-means Clustering
  Use the K-means algorithm to image compression by reducing the number of colors to only those most common in that image. 
### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  Use PCA to perform dimensionality reduction for a 5000 face image dataset.
